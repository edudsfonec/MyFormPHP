# MyFormPHP

This repository is a simple web form project developed as my very first foray into PHP. It was created as part of basic exercises to understand the fundamentals of the PHP language.

## About the Project

**MyFormPHP** is a straightforward web application featuring a basic HTML form that processes user input using PHP. The goal of this project was to provide a hands-on learning experience, helping me grasp core PHP concepts such as:

-   Handling form submissions (`$_POST`)
-   Basic data processing and display
-   Integration of HTML, CSS, and PHP

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the structure of the web page and the form itself.
* **CSS:** For basic styling to make the form presentable.
* **PHP:** For server-side processing of the form data.

## How to Run (Local Setup)

To run this project locally, you'll need a web server environment with PHP installed (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or a Docker setup).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/edudsfonec/MyFormPHP.git](https://github.com/edudsfonec/MyFormPHP.git)
    ```
2.  **Place the files in your web server's document root:**
    Copy the `MyFormPHP` folder into your web server's `htdocs` (Apache) or `www` (Nginx) directory.
3.  **Access in your browser:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/MyFormPHP/index.html` (or the appropriate path for your server configuration).

## Learnings

This first project was a crucial step in my journey to learn web development. It provided practical experience with server-side scripting and the fundamental interaction between client-side (HTML/CSS) and server-side (PHP) technologies.
