# MyFormPHP

This repository is a simple web form project developed as my very first foray into PHP. It was created as part of basic exercises to understand the fundamentals of the PHP language.

## About the Project

**MyFormPHP** is a straightforward web application featuring a basic HTML form that processes user input using PHP. The goal of this project was to provide a hands-on learning experience, helping me grasp core PHP concepts such as:

-   Handling form submissions (`$_POST`)
-   Basic data processing and display
-   Integration of HTML, CSS, and PHP

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the structure of the web page and the form itself.
* **CSS:** For basic styling to make the form presentable.
* **PHP:** For server-side processing of the form data.

## Learnings

This first project was a crucial step in my journey to learn web development. It provided practical experience with server-side scripting and the fundamental interaction between client-side (HTML/CSS) and server-side (PHP) technologies.
